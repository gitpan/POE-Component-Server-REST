Revision history for Perl extension POE::Component::Server::REST.

SourceCode and diffs can be found on: https://github.com/jstebens/POE-Component-Server-REST

* 1.06
  - Default content type is now JSON - see "Q: Why is JSON even supported?" in README/POD
  - Services in URI are now case-insensitive ie. /Foo/baz and /foo/baz are now the same service "foo", this is not valid for paths behind services.
  - Fixed the example server in order to improve understanding.
  - Spit out a valid service list if addressed service wasnt found.
  - Fixed some double declarations - for the sake of clean code.
  - Changed the way how services are referenced in the URI. The URI should now be in the form of /<service>/<resources>/<key> 
  - Fixed: #68826 by revamping the service/method/key extraction - query paramter ?session= is no longer supported - because I can.
  - Splitting URIs is now down in a clean way using URI::Split, instead of reinventing the wheel. (breaking NIH)
  - Removed all http status code constants and using the one of HTTP::Status (breaking INH)
