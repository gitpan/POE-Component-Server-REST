Legend: 
  F: Fixed 
  E: Enhanced
  N: New

* 1.09
  - Fixed Unmarshalling/Marshalling YAML, YAML::Tiny doesnt export Load/Dump by default, added imports.

* 1.08
  - Documentation release!
  - Updated documentation.
  - Updated example server.

* 1.07
  - (N) Added a hierarchical method tree with subpath delegation.
    This allows ALL SORTS OF KEYS, not only numeric, for specific paths and its subpaths.
    Setup: 
		GET/library/author points to the method &get_author
		GET/library/author/douglas/adams to &get_special_author
	Example: 
		Calling GET /library/author/douglas triggers the method &get_author with paramter "douglas"
		Calling GET /library/author/douglas/adams/1979/10/12 triggers the method &get_special_author with parameter "1979/10/12"
    Please see the examples/server.pl file for a working example.
  - (F) Set DEBUG to false by default. Was turned on.
  - (E) Reduced the complexity of the example server.
  - (E) Changed the example in examples/server.pl to sth more daily like authors in a library.
  - (E) Added example debug switch in the example server.

* 1.06
  - Default content type is now JSON - see "Q: Why is JSON even supported?" in README/POD
  - Services in URI are now case-insensitive ie. /Foo/baz and /foo/baz are now the same service "foo", this is not valid for paths behind services.
  - Fixed the example server in order to improve understanding.
  - Spit out a valid service list if addressed service wasnt found.
  - Fixed some double declarations - for the sake of clean code.
  - Changed the way how services are referenced in the URI. The URI should now be in the form of /<service>/<resources>/<key> 
  - Fixed: #68826 by revamping the service/method/key extraction - query paramter ?session= is no longer supported - because I can.
  - Splitting URIs is now down in a clean way using URI::Split, instead of reinventing the wheel. (breaking NIH)
  - Removed all http status code constants and using the one of HTTP::Status (breaking INH)
